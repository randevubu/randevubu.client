# 🏙️ City-Based Pricing Implementation

## ✅ Implementation Complete

The city-based pricing system has been successfully integrated into your frontend application. Here's what has been implemented:

## 🔧 What Was Added

### 1. **Updated TypeScript Types** (`src/types/subscription.ts`)
- Added `basePrice` field to `SubscriptionPlan` interface
- Added `locationPricing` field with city, state, country, tier, and multiplier info
- Added `Location` interface for location detection data
- Added `PricingResponse` interface for API responses
- Added `CityOption` interface for city selector

### 2. **Enhanced API Services**
- **PaymentsService** (`src/lib/services/payments.ts`):
  - `getSubscriptionPlans(city?: string)` - Get plans with optional city parameter
  - `getSubscriptionPlansWithLocation(city?: string)` - Get plans with location data
- **SubscriptionService** (`src/lib/services/subscription.ts`):
  - Updated `getSubscriptionPlans()` to support city parameter
  - Added `getSubscriptionPlansWithLocation()` method

### 3. **New CitySelector Component** (`src/components/ui/CitySelector.tsx`)
- Dropdown with 15+ Turkish cities
- Tier-based color coding (Tier 1: Red, Tier 2: Yellow, Tier 3: Green)
- Auto-detection indicators
- Responsive design with theme support

### 4. **Enhanced Pricing Component** (`src/components/ui/Pricing.tsx`)
- Integrated city selector
- Location detection display
- Price breakdown showing base price × multiplier
- Automatic IP-based location detection
- Manual city override functionality

### 5. **Styling** (`src/styles/globals.css`)
- City selector dropdown styles
- Location info display styles
- Pricing breakdown styles
- Tier-based color coding
- Responsive design

## 🚀 How It Works

### Automatic Detection
1. When the pricing page loads, it calls `/api/v1/subscriptions/plans` without parameters
2. Server detects user's location via IP geolocation
3. Returns location-adjusted pricing with location metadata
4. Frontend displays pricing with location info

### Manual City Selection
1. User selects a city from the dropdown
2. Frontend calls `/api/v1/subscriptions/plans?city={cityName}`
3. Server returns pricing for the selected city
4. Frontend updates display with new pricing

### Pricing Display
- Shows final price prominently (no breakdown)
- Clean, simple pricing display
- Subtle location indicator
- No confusing pricing calculations shown to users

## 🎯 Key Features

- ✅ **Automatic IP Detection** - No user input required
- ✅ **Manual City Override** - Users can select different cities
- ✅ **Location-Based Pricing** - Pricing automatically adjusted by city
- ✅ **Fallback Safety** - Always shows pricing even if detection fails
- ✅ **Backward Compatible** - Existing API calls still work
- ✅ **Responsive Design** - Works on all devices
- ✅ **Theme Support** - Integrates with your existing theme system
- ✅ **Turkish Localization** - All text in Turkish

## 📱 User Experience

1. **First Visit**: User sees pricing automatically detected for their location
2. **City Selection**: User can change city using the dropdown
3. **Clean Pricing**: User sees only the final price (no confusing breakdowns)
4. **Subtle Feedback**: Simple location indicator without overwhelming details

## 🔄 API Integration

The implementation expects your server to return data in this format:

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "statusCode": 200,
  "message": "Subscription plans retrieved successfully",
  "data": {
    "plans": [
      {
        "id": "plan_starter_monthly",
        "name": "starter",
        "displayName": "Starter Plan",
        "price": 1500,
        "basePrice": 750,
        "currency": "TRY",
        "billingInterval": "MONTHLY",
        "locationPricing": {
          "city": "Istanbul",
          "state": "Istanbul",
          "country": "Turkey",
          "tier": "TIER_1",
          "multiplier": 2.0
        }
      }
    ],
    "location": {
      "city": "Istanbul",
      "state": "Istanbul",
      "country": "Turkey",
      "detected": true,
      "source": "ip_geolocation",
      "accuracy": "low"
    }
  }
}
```

## 🧪 Testing

To test the implementation:

1. **Auto-detection**: Visit `/pricing` - should show your detected location
2. **Manual selection**: Use the city dropdown to select different cities
3. **Price changes**: Verify prices change based on city selection
4. **Responsive**: Test on mobile and desktop
5. **Theme**: Test with light/dark themes

## 🔧 Configuration

### Supported Cities
The system includes all 81 Turkish cities with location-based pricing:

**Tier 1 (2.0x multiplier):** İstanbul, Ankara

**Tier 2 (1.5x multiplier):** İzmir, Bursa, Antalya, Gaziantep, Konya, Eskişehir, Diyarbakır, Samsun, Denizli, Kayseri, Mersin, Erzurum, Trabzon, Balıkesir, Kahramanmaraş, Van, Manisa, Sivas, Batman

### Adding More Cities
To add more cities, update the `CITY_OPTIONS` array in `src/components/ui/CitySelector.tsx`.

## 🎨 Customization

### Styling
All styles use CSS custom properties for theme integration:
- Colors: `var(--theme-primary)`, `var(--theme-card)`, etc.
- Responsive: Mobile-first design
- Animations: Smooth transitions and hover effects

### Text
All user-facing text is in Turkish and can be customized in the component files.

## ✅ Ready to Use

The city-based pricing system is now fully integrated and ready to use! Users will automatically see location-appropriate pricing, and they can manually select different cities if needed.

The implementation is backward compatible, so existing functionality will continue to work while new users get the enhanced city-based pricing experience.
