# ðŸš€ PWA Test Guide

## Quick Start Testing

### 1. Start the Development Server
```bash
npm run dev
```

### 2. Visit Test Page
Navigate to: `http://localhost:3000/test`

### 3. Test Steps
1. **Click "1. Request Notification Permission"**
   - Should prompt for notification permission
   - Check browser console for logs

2. **Click "2. Subscribe to Push Notifications"**
   - Will attempt to subscribe to push notifications
   - Requires backend to be running

3. **Click "3. Send Test Notification"**
   - Sends a test notification
   - Should appear as browser notification

## Backend Requirements

Your backend should be running on `http://localhost:3001` with these endpoints:
- `GET /api/v1/notifications/push/vapid-key`
- `POST /api/v1/notifications/push/subscribe`
- `POST /api/v1/notifications/push/test`

## Testing Without Backend

If you don't have the backend running, you can still test:
1. Service Worker registration
2. PWA manifest loading
3. Installation prompts (in production build)

## Production Testing

For full PWA testing:
```bash
npm run build
npm start
```

Then visit `http://localhost:3000/test` in Chrome/Edge for:
- PWA installation prompts
- Add to homescreen
- Offline functionality

## Debugging

Check these in browser DevTools:
- **Console**: Error messages and logs
- **Application > Service Workers**: Registration status
- **Application > Manifest**: PWA manifest validity
- **Network**: API call success/failure

## Common Issues

1. **Service Worker not registering**: Check console for errors
2. **Notifications not working**: Ensure permission granted
3. **PWA not installable**: Must be HTTPS (except localhost)
4. **Backend errors**: Ensure backend is running and CORS configured

## Expected Behavior

âœ… Service worker registers successfully  
âœ… PWA manifest loads without errors  
âœ… Notification permission can be requested  
âœ… Push subscription works (with backend)  
âœ… Test notifications appear  
âœ… PWA can be installed (production build)  

## Icons

I've created basic SVG icons for testing. For production:
1. Replace `/public/icon-192.svg` and `/public/icon-512.svg` with PNG versions
2. Update manifest.json to use `.png` instead of `.svg`
3. Use your actual app logo/branding
