# Push Notification Fix Guide

## 🔧 Issue Fixed: Push Notifications Not Working

### Problem
Push notifications weren't working on the test page because:
1. Service worker was trying to register `/sw.js` (minified, no push handlers)
2. No proper push event handlers in the service worker
3. Subscription flow wasn't properly validated

### Solution

#### 1. **Created New Service Worker** (`/public/sw-custom.js`)
- ✅ Includes push notification event handlers
- ✅ Handles `push`, `notificationclick`, `notificationclose` events
- ✅ Includes basic PWA caching functionality
- ✅ Handles subscription changes

#### 2. **Updated Push Notification Service**
Changed service worker registration from:
```typescript
// OLD - won't work
navigator.serviceWorker.register('/sw.js')

// NEW - works!
navigator.serviceWorker.register('/sw-custom.js', {
  scope: '/',
  updateViaCache: 'none'
})
```

#### 3. **Enhanced Test Page UI**
Added better debugging information:
- Shows permission status (granted/denied/waiting)
- Shows subscription state
- Shows error messages
- Added "Test Push" button when subscribed

## 📋 How to Test

### Step 1: Clear Old Service Workers
1. Open DevTools (F12)
2. Go to **Application** tab
3. Click **Service Workers** in left sidebar
4. Click **Unregister** for any existing workers
5. **Reload** the page (Ctrl+R)

### Step 2: Subscribe to Push Notifications
1. Go to `/test-reminders` page
2. Click **"Push Bildirimleri Aktifleştir"**
3. Allow notification permission when browser asks
4. You should see: ✅ Push bildirimleri aktif

### Step 3: Test Push Notification
**Option 1: Use Test Button**
- Click the **"🔔 Test Push Gönder"** button
- You should see a test notification

**Option 2: Test with Appointment**
- Select an appointment from the list
- Click **"📱 PUSH"** button
- Customer will receive the notification

## 🔍 Debugging Checklist

### If subscription fails:

1. **Check Browser Console**
   ```javascript
   // Should see these logs:
   [Service Worker] RandevuBu Service Worker with Push Notifications loaded
   Service Worker registered: ...
   Service Worker is ready
   Successfully subscribed to push notifications
   ```

2. **Check Service Worker Status**
   - DevTools → Application → Service Workers
   - Should show `/sw-custom.js` as **activated and running**

3. **Check Notification Permission**
   ```javascript
   console.log(Notification.permission); // Should be "granted"
   ```

4. **Check Push Subscription**
   ```javascript
   navigator.serviceWorker.ready.then(reg => {
     reg.pushManager.getSubscription().then(sub => {
       console.log('Subscription:', sub); // Should not be null
     });
   });
   ```

### If notification doesn't appear:

1. **Check Browser Notifications are Enabled**
   - Windows: Settings → System → Notifications
   - macOS: System Preferences → Notifications
   - Chrome: Settings → Privacy and security → Site Settings → Notifications

2. **Check Site Notification Permission**
   - Click 🔒 icon in address bar
   - Ensure "Notifications" is set to "Allow"

3. **Check Service Worker Push Handler**
   - DevTools → Application → Service Workers
   - Look for push event logs in console

4. **Test with curl (Backend)**
   ```bash
   # Send test notification from backend
   curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/v1/businesses/my-business/test-reminder \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"channels": ["PUSH"]}'
   ```

## 🚀 Production Deployment

### Before deploying:

1. **Verify service worker is built**
   ```bash
   ls public/sw-custom.js  # Should exist
   ```

2. **Test in production mode locally**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   npm start
   # Then test push notifications
   ```

3. **Ensure HTTPS is enabled**
   - Push notifications require HTTPS in production
   - Local development (localhost) works without HTTPS

4. **Configure VAPID keys on backend**
   - Ensure backend has valid VAPID keys
   - Keys should be in environment variables

- ✅ `/public/sw-custom.js` - New service worker with push support
- ✅ `/public/offline.html` - Offline fallback page
- ✅ `PUSH_NOTIFICATION_FIX.md` - This guide

### Modified:
- ✅ `src/lib/services/pushNotification.ts` - Updated SW registration
- ✅ `src/app/test-reminders/page.tsx` - Enhanced debugging UI

### Existing (No changes needed):
- ✅ `src/lib/hooks/usePushNotifications.ts` - Already correct

## ⚠️ Important Notes

1. **Service Worker Update**:
   - If you update `sw-custom.js`, users need to hard refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R)
   - Or wait for automatic update (can take 24 hours)

2. **Browser Compatibility**:
   - ✅ Chrome/Edge: Full support
   - ✅ Firefox: Full support
   - ✅ Safari 16+: Full support
   - ❌ Safari <16: No push notification support

3. **Development vs Production**:
   - Development: localhost works without HTTPS
   - Production: **MUST** use HTTPS for push notifications

4. **Rate Limiting**:
   - SMS tests: 5 minutes cooldown
   - Push tests: No limit (free)

## 📞 Support

If push notifications still don't work after following this guide:

1. Check browser console for errors
2. Check backend logs for VAPID key issues
3. Verify API endpoints are correct
4. Check network tab for failed requests
5. Try in incognito/private mode

**Common Issues:**
- **"Service Worker registration failed"** → Check if sw-custom.js exists in /public
- **"VAPID key not available"** → Backend needs to provide VAPID key
- **"Notification permission denied"** → User needs to enable in browser settings
- **No notification appears** → Check OS notification settings
